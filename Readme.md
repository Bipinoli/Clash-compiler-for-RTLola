# Hardware monitor from RTLola specifications by compiling to Clash

Many critical systems rely on real-time monitoring to ensure correct and safe operation. To guarantee the reliability of these monitoring systems themselves, formal specification languages such as RTLola have been developed. Given the low-latency requirements of real-time environments, implementing monitors in dedicated hardware can offer significant performance benefits. 

This work explores the automatic generation of hardware-based monitors, specifically, synthesizing hardware circuits directly from RTLola specifications.
